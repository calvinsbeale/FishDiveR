## Future expansion possibilities
# include down-sampling code as a function
# add option to include lag in sunrise and sunset?
# include plots of time at depth and time at temperature
# include functionality to import data sets with breaks (transmitted data)
# return lists with all data to allow users to produce their own plots
# map cluster results against daily GPS locations
# add SD option to the standardised mean value of k-means features (daily stats) plot
# add fixed minimum depth option to plots e.g. 0m.

# Would clusters be different if separated by 6am instead of midnight? only works in the tropics
# can 24-hour segments be different lengths?
